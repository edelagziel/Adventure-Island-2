# Project State

## AD-21 - Fruit collection and Power gain

- Status: integrated into `master` as commit `735f555` and moved to Jira Done on 2026-09-18.
- `FruitPickup` specializes the existing `PickUp` template, uses one configured Power amount, and delegates collection effects to `PowerController.AddPower(...)`.
- Scene-owned Fruit components receive `PowerController` through the `Fruits` root in `PowerLifetimeScope`'s Auto Inject Game Objects list; no `FruitLifetimeScope` or per-fruit registrations are used.
- The unchanged `PickUp` template deactivates a Fruit after every valid Player pickup, including when Power is already at maximum.
- Runtime Fruit creation, a Fruit factory, and Fruit pooling remain deferred.
- Verification: production code and saved-scene structure passed static checks. Final gameplay trigger behavior was not runtime-confirmed because the temporary test Player's `Rigidbody2D` had `Simulated` disabled; Eden explicitly approved the current implementation after that diagnosis.

## AD-23 - Reset and initialize Power for stage/life start

- Adds `void ResetPower()` to `IPowerModel`, implemented by `PowerModel` by restoring its validated `InitialPower`.
- Adds `PowerController.ResetPower()`, which commands the Model and synchronizes the existing `IPowerView`.
- No lifecycle, lives, respawn, stage reload, event, or scene behavior is part of AD-23.
- Verified by successful Power and game-assembly builds and an in-memory check of construction, Model reset, and Controller/View synchronization.
- Future dependency: when the Lives / GameFlow system exists, `PowerController` will publish `PowerReachedMinimum`; its coordinator will handle life loss and call `PowerController.ResetPower()` only when a new attempt begins. Power remains independent of lives and restart behavior.

## AD-22 - Power-minimum notification

- Status: completed and integrated into `master` on 2026-09-18.
- `IPowerModel` exposes its configured `MinimumPower`, allowing `PowerController` to compare it with `CurrentPower` after a successful reduction.
- `PowerController.PowerReachedMinimum` notifies external observers only after the View reflects a transition to minimum Power. It does not fire at construction or for repeated reductions already at the minimum, and can notify again after Power rises and is depleted.
- Focused EditMode tests cover ordinary, exact, clamped, repeated, initial-minimum, replenished, nonzero-minimum, and View-before-notification cases. The Power and test assemblies compile successfully.
- No Lives, respawn, reset trigger, scene, or subscriber is introduced. A future Lives / GameFlow coordinator owns subscribing and reacting to this notification.
